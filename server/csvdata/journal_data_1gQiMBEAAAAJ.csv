"Group normalization-based 2D-convolutional neural network for intelligent bearing fault diagnosis","D Gilbert Chandra, U Srinivasulu Reddy, G Uma, M Umapathy","2023/11","Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering","45","11","584","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","Rolling element bearings (REBs) in rotating machinery are vulnerable to failures, leading to huge losses in production, and are a concern for human safety also. Bearing fault diagnosis (BFD) is to detect, isolate and identify the faults before the failure happens. The traditional methods of fault classification involve the identification of the discriminating fault features using signal processing techniques, by system experts with specific domain knowledge, and are person dependent, laborious, time-consuming, and prone to errors. It is essential to detect REB faults early when the fault is small and needs to be done without human intervention. Deep learning (DL) models like convolutional neural networks (CNN) can detect and classify the REB faults, using the vibration data during the rotary machine operations. The objective of the proposed work is to design an intelligent BFD system based on the deep learning …"
"A new efficient quorum planted (ℓ, d) motif search on ChIP-seq dataset using segmentation to filtration and freezing firefly algorithms","P Theepalakshmi, U Srinivasulu Reddy","2023/10/20","Soft Computing","N/A","N/A","1-22","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","A comprehensive understanding of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is a key problem in contemporary biology, which is a critical issue in gene regulation. Identifying a pattern of TFBSs in every DNA sequence, motif discovery reveals the basic regulatory relationship and compassionate the evolutionary system of every species. In this case, recognizing the high-quality (ℓ, d) motif is a great challenge. This problem is addressed in motif discovery and motif finding, using the proposed algorithms, such as Segmentation to Filtration (S2F) and Firefly with FREEZE (FFF), respectively. In this study, the whole DNA sequences are divided into two segments. Segment 1 involves motif discovery and is sliced by base and sub k-mers applying an iterative approach, followed by filtration 1 and 2 techniques, respectively. This approach obtains the top five percent of the best motifs (TOPbk_mer) based on accuracy. In …"
"An improved customized CNN model for adaptive recognition of cerebral palsy people’s handwritten digits in assessment","Muthureka, K., Srinivasulu Reddy, U. & Janet","2023/8/9","International Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval","12","N/A","N/A","N/A","Cerebral palsy (CP) is used to describe a group of disorders, characterized by non-progressive, but permanent damage to the developing brain that results in motor deficits, functional difficulties, sensory impairments, and cognitive impairments. AI is rapidly developing with special importance to education and healthcare. Interdisciplinary research perspectives and applications have come up as a helping hand to meet out the needs in different paradigm of Assessment and Biomedicine. At this juncture, building assessment tools for people with motor coordinate impairment is a valuable yet novel research challenge. So, authors implement a handwritten digit recognition system using optical character recognition (OCR) on dataset of CP people’s handwritten digits and based on study the problem statement is defined to detect variation in jerking hands on written to optical digits by proposing a custom convolutional …"
"Critical measurement parameters estimation in liquid rocket engine using LSTM-based soft sensor","M Devakumar, G Uma, M Umapathy","2023/8/1","Flow Measurement and Instrumentation","92","N/A","102371","Elsevier","Abstract Liquid Rocket engines (LREs) need to be hot tested on the ground, in order to make them flight-worthy. Ground hot tests are critical, expensive, and involve considerable human efforts in acquiring the critical measurement parameters. Measurement sensors are prone to failure due to the hazardous propellant environment and are vulnerable to noise (internal and external) during the LRE ground hot tests. The usage of redundant sensors is not a viable solution for space applications due to cost, power, weight, and space constraints. Data-driven Soft Sensors (SS) are being used in different industrial processes. SS can provide an effective alternative and economical solution for space applications. The objective of the proposed work is to implement a suitable data-driven soft sensor for estimating three critical measurement parameters namely, turbine speed, chamber pressure (P c), and propellant flow rate of …"
