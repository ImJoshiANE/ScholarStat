"Estimating fish weight growth in aquaponic farming through machine learning techniques","Purushottam Kumar, Pranav Tiwari, U Srinivasulu Reddy","2023/6/23","2023 3rd International Conference on Intelligent Technologies (CONIT)","1-7","IEEE","Due to the ever-growing population, rapid urbanization, unusual environmental change, and dwindling water supply, the food production from conventional farming techniques won’t be able to keep up with increasing food demand for long, leading to severe food scarcity. Aquaponics is emerging as a viable alternative to food cultivation techniques but lacks efficiency, hindering its adoption on a large-scale production basis. The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in smart aquaponic farming can further contribute to increasing the yield in aquaponics. In the study, both linear and non-linear regression algorithms such as linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, KNN regression, SVR, and decision tree regression were trained on aquaponic fish pond dataset, evaluated on the basis of multiple metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RMSLE, and a competitive analysis was done to determine the …"
