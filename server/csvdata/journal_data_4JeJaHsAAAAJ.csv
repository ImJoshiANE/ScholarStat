"A Framework for Migration of Microservices based Applications to Serverless Platform with Efficient Cold Start Latency","Vinay Raj","2023/10/5","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","TechRxiv","Serverless computing has become a very popular cloud-based solution for designing, testing and deploying the applications as serverless functions. Serverless computing has become a buzzword in both industry and academia as many large IT giants have rolled out their own serverless platforms. Independent design, deployment and auto scalability are its major features with Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) as its popular implementation. On the other hand, microservices are an emerging trend for design of large enterprise applications as many companies like Amazon, Uber and Spotify have already migrated their existing applications to microservices style. However, with the advent of serverless platforms, to design efficient applications with simpler infrastructure management, reduced operational overhead and cost factor, migrating microservices to serverless has become inevitable. Additionally, existing studies report that serverless platforms suffer from cold start latency. Therefore, in this paper, a framework is proposed which has two phases: (i) an empirical investigation to find out the impact of programming language on the cold start of serverless functions and (ii) an approach for migration of microservices to serverless platforms. The evaluation results help us to identify the platform with low cold start latency and also recommend the choice of programming language with lower latency. After migrating the containerized microservices to serverless, a comparison in terms of performance is conducted. The applications designed as serverless functions exhibit better response time and throughput compared to containerized microservices."
"Assessing the Impact of Migration from SOA to Microservices Architecture","Vinay Raj, Hanumanthu Bhukya","2023/7/31","SN Computer Science","4","5","577","Springer Nature Singapore","Microservices has become a buzzword in IT and large enterprise firms such as Netflix, Twitter, Spotify and others have started to design their applications by adopting this new architectural style. A few organizations have started migrating their traditional monolithic and SOA-based applications to microservices in order to benefit from the features of new style. Software architects, on the other hand, are in chaos whether to adopt this new style or not as they are unaware of the pros and cons of microservices architecture. Also, the impact of the migration on SOA-based applications in terms of performance and complexity is unknown, leading to dilemma on the migration process. In this paper, a study of the migration impact on the existing SOA based applications to microservices is presented. For this study, change propagation probability and architectural stability metrics are used to examine the effect of migrating a …"
"Empirical Evaluation of Microservices Architecture Check for updates","Neha Kaushik, Harish Kumar, Vinay Raj","2023/7/10","Communication and Intelligent Systems: Proceedings of ICCIS 2022, Volume 2","689","N/A","241","Springer Nature","Microservices architecture has gained a lot of interest in recent times in designing large enterprise applications with coupling and scalability as its significant features. Microservices architecture is an architectural approach in which large applications are split into small, loosely coupled services that communicate with one another using lightweight protocols such as RESTful APIs. The identified microservices must be monitored and assessed in order to determine the areas that need to be improved. Therefore, it is required to study the tools and metrics that can help practitioners and developers to continuously evaluate the quality of microservice-based architectures and provide suggestions for refactoring them. This work adapted the empirically based architecture evaluation (EBAE) method for evaluating the microservices-based applications. A web-based application is chosen as a case study and metrics related to QoS attributes are considered. The results obtained are presented, and it is clear from the results that microservices architecture can be strongly recommended for the design of large enterprise applications."
"A Generative Model Based Chatbot Using Recurrent Neural Networks","Vinay Raj, MSB Phridviraj","2022/12/22","N/A","N/A","N/A","379-392","Springer Nature Switzerland","Conversational modeling is an important task in natural language understanding and machine intelligence. It makes sense for natural language to become the primary way in which we interact with devices because that is how humans communicate with each other. Thus, the possibility of having conversations with machines would make our interaction much more smooth and human-like. The natural language techniques need to be evolved to match the level of power and sophistication that users expect from virtual assistants. Although previous approaches exist, they are often restricted to specific domains and require handcrafted rules. The obvious problem lies in their inability to answer questions for which the rules were not written. To overcome this problem, we build a generative model neural conversation system using a deep LSTM Sequence to Sequence model with an attention mechanism. Our main …"
"A service graph based extraction of microservices from monolith services of service‐oriented architecture","Vinay Raj, Sadam Ravichandra","2022/7","Software: Practice and Experience","52","7","1661-1678","N/A"," Service‐oriented architecture (SOA) has been widely used to design enterprise applications in the past two decades. The services in SOA are becoming complex with the increase in changing user requirements and SOA is still seen as monolithic from a deployment perspective. Monolithic services make the application complex, and it becomes difficult to maintain. With the evolution of microservices architecture, software architects started migrating legacy applications to microservices. However, existing migration approaches in the literature mostly focus on migrating monolithic applications to microservices. To the best of our knowledge, very few works have been done in migrating SOA applications to microservices. One of the major challenges in the migration process is the extraction of microservices from the existing legacy applications. To address this, we propose an approach to extract the candidate …"
